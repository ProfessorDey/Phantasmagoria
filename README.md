Phantasmagoria - A Dark Horror Text Adventure

Phantasmagoria is a text adventure game written in C++ by Joshua Lewis Hayes as part of his University Coursework.

It is provided here for people to play themselves or modify if they so wish.

Please note that due to time constraints on the coursework, and unfamiliarity with ncurses, the linux rendering backend was not completed, however, the code itself is backend agnostic for the most part and so a linux renderer may be completed in the future, though priority may be given to attempting to port the entire project over to Idris as a coding exercise, at which point a linux port is guarenteed, due to no longer running Windows at all.

I hope you all enjoy,
Joshua L Hayes
